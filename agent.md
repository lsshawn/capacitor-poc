POC iOS Uber-like App (Capacitor + Svelte)

üéØ Goal

Build a Proof of Concept iOS app using Svelte + Capacitor 7 to validate Uber-like background functionality:
	‚Ä¢	Background location tracking (via @capacitor/background-runner + @capacitor/geolocation).
	‚Ä¢	Push / local notifications (ride request simulation).
	‚Ä¢	Local trip history storage (via @capacitor/preferences).

No backend ‚Äî all mocks and storage are local.

‚∏ª

üìå Scope

Must-Have
	1.	Background Location Tracking
	‚Ä¢	Foreground: track GPS with @capacitor/geolocation.
	‚Ä¢	Background: run isolated JS task with @capacitor/background-runner to periodically log GPS and store in Preferences.
	‚Ä¢	Display driver‚Äôs path in a simple Svelte map view.
	2.	Push / Local Notifications
	‚Ä¢	Use @capacitor/local-notifications (or @capacitor/push-notifications in dev mode) to simulate ride requests.
	‚Ä¢	Handle tap ‚Üí deep link into Ride Detail page.
	3.	Trip History
	‚Ä¢	Persist trips using @capacitor/preferences.
	‚Ä¢	History screen shows list of trips with timestamp + distance.

Nice-to-Have
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúRequest Ride‚Äù button ‚Üí fires a local notification.
	‚Ä¢	SOS button ‚Üí logs alert + shows confirmation dialog.
	‚Ä¢	Driver availability toggle ‚Üí controls whether background-runner geolocation runs.

Out of Scope
	‚Ä¢	Payments.
	‚Ä¢	Real-time dispatch.
	‚Ä¢	Network sync.

‚∏ª

üõ† Tech Stack (from package.json)
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Svelte 5 + SvelteKit + TailwindCSS + DaisyUI.
	‚Ä¢	Capacitor Core: @capacitor/core, @capacitor/ios.
	‚Ä¢	Background Execution: @capacitor/background-runner.
	‚Ä¢	Geolocation: @capacitor/geolocation.
	‚Ä¢	Notifications: @capacitor/push-notifications, @capacitor/local-notifications (simulation).
	‚Ä¢	Storage: @capacitor/preferences (simple key-value, POC safe).
	‚Ä¢	UI Helpers: @iconify/svelte (icons).

üîë Requirements Breakdown

1. Background Location Tracking
	‚Ä¢	Enable Background Modes ‚Üí Location Updates in Xcode.
	‚Ä¢	Register a Background Runner task (e.g., tasks/location.ts).
	‚Ä¢	Runner task responsibilities:
	‚Ä¢	Get location (Geolocation.getCurrentPosition()).
	‚Ä¢	Save path in Preferences (append JSON).
	‚Ä¢	Throttle updates (e.g., 30‚Äì60s).

Acceptance Test: Lock phone, move around, reopen ‚Üí path recorded in history.

‚∏ª

2. Notifications
	‚Ä¢	Use LocalNotifications.schedule() to simulate:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúNew Ride Request‚Äù event.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúTrip Complete‚Äù event.
	‚Ä¢	Handle notification taps to navigate to Ride Detail page.

Acceptance Test: App minimized ‚Üí trigger notification ‚Üí tap ‚Üí app opens detail screen.

‚∏ª

3. Trip History
	‚Ä¢	Each trip = JSON object {id, startTime, endTime, distance, path[]}.
	‚Ä¢	Store in Preferences under a trips key.
	‚Ä¢	History page reads/parses and lists trips.

Acceptance Test: Complete mock trip ‚Üí reopen app ‚Üí trip persists in history.

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints
	‚Ä¢	Background Runner: not all Capacitor plugins are available (needs testing for Geolocation + Preferences).
	‚Ä¢	Permissions: iOS requires Always Allow for background GPS.
	‚Ä¢	Battery: location polling interval should be tuned (not real-time).

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	iOS app bundle (Svelte + Capacitor).
	‚Ä¢	Demo workflow:
	1.	Driver location tracked in background.
	2.	Rider request simulated via notification.
	3.	Trip stored + visible in history screen.
